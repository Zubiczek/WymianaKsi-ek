WymianaKsiążek(BookExchange) - web application / online portal advertisement for books.

The application was designed to sell and exchange books. Users can add their own offer with book, search others and communicate with people to make a deal. Application 
offers easy search functions so users can easily find what they are interested in. The application offers little book forum, when users can share their opinions about books. Users can communicate with each other by implemented chat. They can report offers and other users when they violate rules.

The project is not over yet, I have a couple ideas to develop it, update and improve existing methods, add more functionalities such as admin panel and payment service.

Thanks to this project i learnt how to build ASP.NET Core MVC application. I learnt Entity Framework and how to use it in practise. That's my first large project in my programming experience so it taught me how to manage a big amount of code. Also it was a good chance to practise my HTML+CSS and Javascript skills and how to use them in practise and connecting frontend and backend. I also learnt was is AJAX and how to call backend methods in javascript code (without refreshing page).
